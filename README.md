This work was done for my Bachelor thesis "Staggered Quantum Walk on Weighted Graphs". The goal was to: 

1) Analyse and benchmark of the Staggered Quantum Walk framework applied to a variety of problems
2) Extension of the Staggered Quantum Walk to Weighted Graphs and proposal of a Pathfinding algorithm for a specific eletrical network problem

The files serve different purposes: 
- `random_graph` tests my weighted staggered quantum walk proposal on randomly generated weighted graphs  
- `tesselated_trees` tests the standard staggered quantum walk on the tesselated tree problem
- `eletrical_network` tests and analyses my my weighted staggered quantum walk proposal on a tested eletrical network and serves a preliminary work for the proposal of the pathfinding algorithm to be developed

Also, my thesis is also in the repository.
